	asl	well, if you import the whole sys, you wouldn't need to import platform
	asl	you can call exit using sys.exit()
	yenic	platform is a part of sys?
	asl	sortof
	asl	there a sys.platform
	asl	$ python -m timeit "import sys; sys.platform"
	asl	1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.25 usec per loop
	asl	$ python -m timeit "import sys; sys.platform"
	asl	1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.3 usec per loop
	asl	$ python -m timeit "import sys; sys.platform"
	asl	1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.24 usec per loop
	asl	$ python -m timeit "import platform; platform.system()"
	asl	100000 loops, best of 3: 2.14 usec per loop
	asl	$ python -m timeit "import platform; platform.system()"
	asl	100000 loops, best of 3: 2.12 usec per loop
	asl	$ python -m timeit "import platform; platform.system()"
	asl	100000 loops, best of 3: 2.17 usec per loop
	yenic	i will look into that. i put that into my notes for that project
	asl	system is faster than platform
